Disease Prediction from Medical Data
Overview
The objective of this task was to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting various diseases based on the symptoms provided in a dataset. This project emphasizes the importance of data-driven solutions in the healthcare domain, allowing for early diagnosis and improved patient care.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from [insert source or link if available]. It contains multiple features representing symptoms and a target variable indicating the prognosis (i.e., the disease).

Features
The dataset consists of the following columns:

Symptoms: Various symptom indicators (e.g., itching, skin rash, nodal skin eruptions, etc.).
Prognosis: The target variable representing the predicted disease.
Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Loaded the dataset and explored its structure.
Handled missing values by removing incomplete entries.
Scaled the features to ensure uniformity in the input data.
Feature Selection:

Identified relevant features to improve model performance.
Dropped the target variable column (prognosis) from the feature set.
Model Building:

Split the data into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
Utilized a Random Forest Classifier due to its robustness and effectiveness in handling classification tasks.
Model Training:

Trained the model on the training dataset.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated the model's performance using accuracy metrics.
Generated a confusion matrix and classification report to visualize the modelâ€™s predictive capabilities.
Results
The model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy percentage] on the test dataset. The evaluation metrics indicated the model's strengths and areas for improvement, paving the way for further enhancements in predictive accuracy.

Conclusion
This task highlighted the significance of machine learning in the healthcare sector, particularly in diagnosing diseases based on symptomatic data. The experience gained during this project will be invaluable as I continue to explore and contribute to the field of data science.
